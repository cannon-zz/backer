           Quick Install Guide for the Backer 16/32 Device Driver
           ======================================================


Here are the steps for installing the driver
--------------------------------------------

1.  Configure the driver parameters for your system.  The constants that
should be set are:

	In backer_isa.c:
		BKR_MAJOR
		BKR_DEF_IOPORT
		BKR_DEF_DMA_CHANNEL

	In backer.h:
		BKR_DEF_MODE

Of these, the only one that actually must be set is the device major
number.  The I/O port and DMA channel can be set at module load time
although you might as well configure them now to simplify things later.  In
the future I will also allow the default (start up) mode to be set at load
time but for now it can only be adjusted at compile time.

Regarding the device major number:  I currently have the driver configured
for device major 60.  This is in one of the blocks of numbers set aside for
``experimental and local use''.  That should do for now unless you've
already got something using number 60.  You can set this to any number your
system isn't using.

2.  Compile and install the driver to the modules directory.  This is done
by typing (while logged in as root)

	make
	make install

or you can just run make and copy the resulting backer.o to your modules
directory, /lib/modules/<kernel version>/misc, yourself.

3.  Create a device file.  Do this (still as root) by typing

	mknod -m 666 /dev/backer c 60 0

or with the 60 replaced with whatever major number you had set in the
header file.  The driver is designed to imitate a standard magnetic tape
drive and if you want to use your Backer as your default tape device you
should also create a symbolic link called /dev/tape

	cp -s /dev/backer /dev/tape

4.  You're Done!  Now load the driver and test it.  See the next section
for how to do this.


Loading/Unloading the Driver
----------------------------

To load the driver, login as root and type

	insmod backer [options]

where the following options can be set:

	ioport=num      Set the I/O port to num.
	dma=num         Set the DMA channel to num.
	buffer=num      Set the DMA buffer size to num bytes.
	timeout=num     Set the timeout to num seconds.

Here's an example install command:

insmod backer ioport=0x304 dma=3

To test the driver just type

	cat /dev/zero > /dev/backer

to verify that data is being written to video.  On your television set you
should see vertical bars for several seconds followed by something that
looks like noise.

To unload the module type

rmmod backer
