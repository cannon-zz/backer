                               INTRODUCTION
                               ============

A Linux 2.4.x device driver for the Backer tape backup devices manufactured
by Danmere Technologies Inc. (now 4-TV).



                          WORKING WITH THE DRIVER
                          =======================

See INSTALL for instructions on compiling, installing and loading the
driver.

See the man pages in DOCUMENTATION/ for information about the driver
itself.  Note that you can view a specific man page by naming the file on
the command line eg.

	$ man ./backer.4

NOTE:  ALTHOUGH THE backer_parport MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED WITH THIS PACKAGE
AND THE DOCUMENTATION DESCRIBES ITS USE, IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND
PROBABLY DOES NOT WORK.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

WON'T COMPILE.  Well... it compiles just fine on my own machine so it would
help if you could find the problem and let me know what it was.  Otherwise
you'd better just contact me and we'll have to sort it out.


DRIVER WON'T LOAD.  Be sure you are logged in as root.  Check
/var/log/messages for complaints about unavailable resources.  If there's a
problem reserving a DMA buffer, try freeing some memory or rebooting your
system and loading the driver soon after start-up.


DRIVER LOADS BUT YOU CAN'T OPEN THE DEVICE FILES.  If the error message is
"Permission denied" then check the permissions of the /dev entries.  They
must allow you to access them.  Be sure that at least one of the low-level
modules is loaded.  Make sure that the minor numbers for the device files
correspond to the correct unit number (see the man page for the mapping of
minor numbers to unit numbers).


YOU CAN OPEN THE DEVICE BUT YOU CAN'T TRANSFER DATA.  As above, make sure
the minor numbers for the device files actually correspond to a valid unit.
Do the following test to see what error message you see

	$ cat /dev/zero > /dev/tape

If you see "Device or resource busy" then check to see that no other
process is transferring data and that the DMA channel is available (check
/proc/dma).  If you see "Out of memory" then your system has run out of
memory.


YOU GET MANY ERRORS WHEN READING TAPES.  Here are some common causes of
read errors:

	-Poor quality, worn, or damaged video tape.  Try using a good
	 quality, never-before-used, tape and see if that improves things.
	-Dirty video heads.  This can be checked by playing a commercial
	 video (eg. a purchased movie) or any other tape known to have a
	 high-quality video signal recorded on it.  If the picture looks
	 crisp and clear then the heads are clean.
	-Poor quality video cables.  Make sure you are using real video
	 cables and not audio cables (both use the same RCA connectors).
	 Generally video cables are thicker and consist of a single
	 cylindrical wire while audio cables might have two wires (bonded
	 together) coming out of *each* plug.  Also, for some reason the
	 video cables I've seen tend to have the colour yellow involved one
	 way or another while audio cables have the colours red and white.
	-Power line noise.  Spikes on the power line will propogate through
	 the VCR and be recorded as a horizontal bar in the video image.
	 They will also corrupt the signal during playback.  Do not engage
	 or disengage heavy duty electrical equipment on the same circuit
	 that your VCR and computer are plugged into.  Especially do not
	 turn on or off any device with electric motors or large
	 transformers on the same circuit (these include electric fans,
	 television sets, and flourescent lights).  Note that the problem
	 is only in turning them on and off --- it is find to have them
	 plugged into the same circuit and even to use them.
	-Static discharge.  As above, static discharges in the vicinity of
	 the computer or VCR can interfere with the video signal.  It helps
	 to have both the computer and VCR plugged into the same outlet and
	 to have as short a video cable connecting them as possible.

If you have assured yourself that none of these problems apply to you, it
is possible that the video format used by this software is not suitable for
your video equipment.  I have only my own equipment to test the software
with and my equipment might not be representative.  Please contact me and
we can discuss the problem.
