                           INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                           =========================

Here are the steps for installing the utilities associated with the Backer
device driver.

1.  Edit the Makefile

There are a few things that need to be set in the Makefile.  These are:

    DRIVER_DIR    The location of the device driver sources.
    DEVICE_NAME   The default device name to compile into the utilities.
    PREFIX        The top of the installation hierarchy.

The defaults for these are probably fine.  The executables will be put in
PREFIX/bin and the man pages in PREFIX/man/man8


2.  Build the utilities.

Typing "make" builds the utilities.  If GTK is not installed then
bkrmonitor will not be built.


3.  Install

Typing "make install" installs the utilities and their man pages.
