1.0 (2001/1/13)
	Changed the 'N' glyph in bkrfont.xpm.

	Got bkr_aux_puts() to generate Backer-friendly data.  This gets
	bkrlog working finally.

	Re-worked bkrlog:  new output scheduler mechanism and cleaner
	handling of tar archive label.

0.12 (2000/12/11)
	The mode indicators in bkrmonitor now indicate the mode and are
	disabled in order to discourage people from trying to click them.
	(this looks stupid but it's good enough for now).

	bkrlog now prints an error message before exiting if it runs out of
	memory.

	Fixed a bug in bkrencode:  while encoding it could get hung on EOF.

	Expanded bkrencode's error reporting to include errors from the
	file system.

0.11 (2000/11/26)
	Re-release to keep the version number in step with the driver.

0.10 (2000/11/21)
	bkrencode now catches SIGINT and generates an EOR mark before
	exiting.

	Changed the '$' glyph in bkrfont.xpm.

	Code clean ups in bkrlog (but don't use it yet) and new messages.

0.9 (2000/11/16)
	Cleaned up some code in bkrmonitor and bkrencode.

0.8 (2000/11/06)
	Fixed error message strings in bkrencode and bkrtest.

	Introduced new utility bkrmonitor.  This is a gtk+ application for
	monitoring the status of the driver and hardware during a transfer.

	Added underflow field to error structure.  This indicates the
	number of underflows detected in the data stream.  These are most
	likely present due to buffer underflows occuring when the data was
	recorded but might also indicate an overflow condition if much time
	has elapsed since the last read.

0.7 (2000/11/03)
	Minor modifications to the I/O code in bkrencode to work with new
	error reporting scheme.  Also made bkrencode abort on any error.

0.6 (2000/10/30)
	Re-release to keep version number in step with driver.

0.5 (2000/10/25)
	bkrlog will now only send an update of the auxiliary region to the
	device if more than 250 milliseconds have elapsed.

	Minor changes to bkrencode to reflect code clean ups in the
	formating layer.

	The font .xpm file's name didn't match the string defined within it
	(I had renamed it without editing the string name).  They match
	now.  I also made changes to the 'm' and 'S' glyphs.

0.4 (2000/10/20)
	Fixed sector efficiency and data rate computation errors in bkrtest
	--- you can now actually use the data rate along with your tape
	length to compute a tape capacity.

0.3 (2000/10/17)
	Re-release to keep version number in step with driver.

0.2 (2000/10/10)
	First public release.
