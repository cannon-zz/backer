           Quick Install Guide for the Backer 16/32 Device Driver
           ======================================================

Preamble:
---------

This is the quick install guide.  Full details are in the real
documentation (the user guide included with this package).  The
instructions here will only be helpful if (i) you know what you are doing
or (ii) you don't know what you're doing but the instructions just happen
to work anyway.  This document assumes you have the hardware installed and
properly configured.


Software:
---------

Here are the steps for installing the driver.

1.  Configure the header file, backer.h, for your system.  The constants
that should be set are:

	BKR_MAJOR
	BKR_DEF_IOPORT
	BKR_DEF_DMA_CHANNEL
	BKR_DEF_MODE

The ioport and dma channel can also be set at run time although you might
as well configure them now to simplify things later.

2.  Compile and install the driver to the modules directory.  This is done
by typing (while logged in as root)

	make
	make install

or you can just run make and copy the resulting backer.o to your modules
directory /lib/modules/<kernel version>/misc yourself.

3.  Create a device file.  Do this (still as root) by typing

	mknod -m 666 /dev/backer c 60 0

or with the "60" replaced with whatever major number you had set in the
header file.  The driver is designed to immitate a standard magnetic tape
drive so if you want to use your Backer as your default tape device you
should also create a symlink called /dev/tape

	cp -s /dev/backer /dev/tape

4.  You're Done!  Now load the driver and test it.  See the next section
for how to do this.


Loading/Unloading the driver:
-----------------------------

To load the driver, log in as root and type

	insmod backer [options]

where the following options can be set:

	ioport=num
		Set the ioport to num
	dma=num
		Set the dma channel to num
	buffer=num
		Set the buffer size to num
	timeout=num
		Set the timeout to num seconds

Here's an example install command:

	insmod backer ioport=0x304 dma=3

You'll get an error message if the driver couldn't be installed.  If that
happens, check /var/log/messages to see what the problem was.  The driver
will have printed a little banner and will have complained if it couldn't
reserve a particular resource.  Note that to allow the dma channel to be
shared, the driver will only request access to it when the device is
actually in use so even if the driver gets installed correctly, there might
still be a dma conflict.  If the driver can't get access to the dma channel
when it needs to then it will put an error message in /var/log/messages.

To test the driver just type

	cat /dev/zero > /dev/backer

to verify that data is being written.  On your television set you should
see vertical bars for several seconds followed by something that looks like
white noise.  See the user's guide for troubleshooting.

To unload the module type

	rmmod backer
