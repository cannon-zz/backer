It's been nearly a year since a version has been released so lots has
changed.&nbsp; A great deal of progress has been made toward supporting the
external version but some issues remain to be resolved before these can be
used reliably.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the user-visible changes:
<ul>
<li>Performance-motivated changes to the native tape format and to the
format used by <font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrenhanced</font> have
reduced CPU overhead significantly (nearly 20%).

<li>Some bugs have been fixed in the tape data processing code that could
have reduced the effectiveness of <font face="Courier
New,Courier">bkrenhanced</font> in the event of an unlikely co-incidence of
conditions.

<li>Homogenized the command-line parameters and responses of several of the
utilities.

<li><font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrcheck</font> now generates a nicer
test pattern than just random noise.

<li><font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrmonitor</font> now monitors all
installed units simultaneously and has been migrated to GTK+ 2.0.

<li>The drivers and utilities have been returned to a single source tree
and the configuration mechanism has been migrated to GNU autoconf.&nbsp;
You should now be able to get a working install by doing the standard <font
face="Courier New,Courier">./configure ; make ; make install</font>.

</ul>
