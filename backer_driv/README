                            WORKING WITH THE DRIVER
                            =======================


See INSTALL for instructions on compiling, installing and loading the
driver.

See the man page (the file named backer.4) for information about the driver
itself.  You can run a file through man by specifying it on the command
line eg.

		man ./backer.4

(the ./ is needed so man knows to look for a file by this name rather than
a man page).


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

WON'T COMPILE.  Well... it compiles just fine on my own machine so it would
help if you could find the problem and let me know what it was.  Otherwise
you'd better just contact me and we'll have to sort it out.

DRIVER WON'T LOAD.  Are you logged in as root?  Check /var/log/messages for
complaints about unavailable resources.  If there's an I/O port conflict,
well you know what to do (just be sure to recompile with updated parameters
or set the correct options on the insmod command line).  If there's a
problem reserving a DMA buffer, try freeing some memory or rebooting your
system and loading the driver soon after start-up.

DRIVER LOADS BUT YOU CAN'T OPEN THE DEVICE FILES.  If the error message is
"Permission denied" then check the permissions of the /dev entries.  They
must allow you access them.

YOU CAN OPEN THE DEVICE BUT YOU CAN'T TRANSFER DATA.  Do the following test
to see what error message you see

	cat /dev/zero > /dev/tape

If you see "Device or resource busy" then make sure that no other process
is transfering data and that the DMA channel is available (check
/proc/dma).  If you see "Input/output error" or "Connection timed out" then
make sure your VCR is properly connected to the card (and turned on) and
make sure that you have the driver set for the correct DMA channel.

YOU GET MANY ERRORS WHEN READING TAPES.  Is the tape you are using of good
quality?  Are your video cables OK?  Generally if the picture you see on TV
while recording looks nice and crisp then the cables are fine.  It might be
that the data format is not appropriate for your video equipment.  You can
experiment with the parameters in the backer_fmt.h and backer_fmt.c file
yourself or contact me and I can help you adjust them.  If you figure them
out yourself then send me the information so I can make the default
settings as generic as possible.

YOU GET FATAL ERRORS FROM tar DURING READS.  I find that tar's buffering of
the data stream defeats itself in that, by default, tar processes so much
data at a time that the device driver's buffer overflows between tar's
(infrequent) reads/writes.  The problem is solved on my system by reducing
tar's record size to its minimum value with the option -b 1.  Larger values
would probably work too but I haven't found any problems with this small
record size either so I just use this.  This option must be given during
playback if it was used when recording.
