.TH BACKER 4 "August 15, 2001" "Linux" "Special Files"
.SH NAME
backer \- Backer video tape based storage device.
.SH INTRODUCTION
The Backer devices, manufactured by Danmere Technologies Ltd., allow data
to be stored on video tape using a standard video cassette recorder.
.PP
Backer devices were manufactured in two configurations:  internal, ISA,
interface cards and an external version that plugs into an ECP-compatible
parallel port.  This driver provides access to both varieties through the
use of two hardware-specific interface modules called
.IR backer_isa (4)
and
.IR backer_parport (4)
respectively.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.SS MODULES
The driver is loaded by loading the main module
.RS
.sp
modprobe backer
.sp
.RE
which in turn requests the module ``backer_lowlevel''.  This is is a dummy
name that is meant to be re-directed to the desired hardware module(s)
through the use of appropriate options in
.IR modules.conf (5).
For example, the line
.RS
.sp
add probeall backer_lowlevel backer_isa
.sp
.RE
would cause the ISA interface module to be loaded.
.SS DEVICE FILES
Each Backer unit attached to the system is represented by a set of
character device files.  By default they are owned by root:root with mode
0666.  The Backer driver does not have a standard major number assigned to
it but the source is distributed with 60 as the default.  This can be
adjusted to the needs of the system.  The minor number encodes the unit
number, video mode, bit density and data format.  In alphabetical order,
the device file names are:

.PP
When used with the device file system (devfs), the necessary files will be
created automatically when the driver is loaded.  The \fIn\fP appearing in
the path of each device as well as in its minor number is the hardware unit
number.  Units are numbered from 0 in the order in which the hardware
modules register them.  The three letter file name identifies the video
mode, the bit density, and the data format selected by accessing that
particular file.
.PP
Depending on how the driver was compiled, some mode combinations might not
be available.  To adjust mode availability, see the \fBbkr_modes[]\fP array
in the sources.
.PP
If a backer device is to be used as the system's default tape device then
it is helpful to create a symbolic link named \fB/dev/tape\fP that points
to the preferred unit and mode.
.SS OPTIONS
The main module,
.IR backer (4),
accepts the following option.
.TP
\fBtimeout=\fInum\fP
Specify the operation timeout in seconds.  A reasonable value is 10
seconds;  it should probably not be set below 4.
.PP
See the man pages for
.IR backer_isa (4)
and
.IR backer_parport (4)
for information on their use.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS GENERAL
The driver presents each Backer device as a set of character device special
files, one for each available format, that try to behave somewhat like
standard tape devices.  It is not possible to provide a fully functional
tape interface because the tape transport itself (your VCR) is not under
computer control.  This means that every task requires operator assistance
to complete in that somebody must manually press Play, Record, Rewind,
etc..  Apart from the lack of automation, however, the driver should be
able to inter-operate with any software designed for use with tape devices
such as
.IR mt (1)
and
.IR tar (1).
.PP
The Backer hardware is compatible with both NTSC and PAL video equipment
and it can modulate the data stream into the video signal at two bit
densities, ``high'' and ``low''.  In addition to the hardware settings, one
can also choose from two tape data formats and a pass-through mode.  One of
the formats is intended for short and long play (SP and LP) recordings and
the other for extended play (EP) recordings while the pass-through mode
by-passes all data processing within the driver providing access to the raw
tape data stream.  The desired settings are selected by accessing the
appropriate device file.
.PP
A data transfer is started by making a call to
.IR read (2)
or
.IR write (2)
and stopped by
.IR close (2).
For obvious practical reasons, only one transfer can occur at a time on
each unit so once a transfer has been started on a file descriptor, all
other reads and writes on all other descriptors corresponding to the same
unit will fail.  Since the hardware is not full duplex, if a device is
opened with mode \fBO_RDWR\fP the first read or write call selects the
transfer direction and any subsequent calls in the other direction fail
until the device is closed and re-opened.
.PP
Data written to and read from the non-raw files is clean, synchronous and
commensurate:  it will be retrieved error-free;  the, say, 2000th byte
written will be the 2000th byte read back;  and exactly as many bytes as
were written will be played back (the data is not padded to a multiple of
some size).
.SS "RAW INTERFACE"
The raw device files provide access to the actual tape data.  When writing,
the first byte written is placed in the first position in the top line of
the first video field and so on.  When reading, all the pleasantries of the
raw video signal are present:  tape noise, missing video lines, etc..  The
interface provided by these files allows the requisite tape data processing
to be performed in user space thus not only permitting tapes in formats
foreign to the driver itself to be read and written but also allowing
computers too slow to perform the processing in real time to make use of
higher bandwidth modes.  See
.IR bkrencode (8)
for more information on using this feature.
.SS "STATUS INFORMATION"
Hardware and driver status information is provided through the \fB/proc\fP
file system by the file \fB /proc/driver/backer\fP.  For each device in the
system, a sequence of data fields is displayed starting with the device
unit number.
.PP
The meaning of each field in this file is given below and indicated after
each field heading is the transfer direction in which the field is
meaningful.  For example, a field marked ``reading'' does not have meaning
during write operations.  Between transfers, all fields will retain their
values from the end of the last transfer.  The information is displayed in
unsigned decimal format and the meaning of the fields is as follows.
.TP
\fBUnit\fP (reading/writing)
The unit number to which the following fields apply and that unit's
operating state:  reading, stopped, suspended or writing.
.TP
\fBCurrent Mode\fP (reading/writing)
A number indicating the video mode, bit density and data format of the
current transfer.  The masks and flags used to interpret this number can be
found in the header file, \fBbacker.h\fP.
.TP
\fBSector Number\fP (reading/writing)
The current sector number being transfered to/from user space.  The
driver's buffers introduce a delay between this and the sector being
transfered to/from the tape.
.TP
\fBByte Errors\fP (reading)
Shows the total number of bad symbols that have been successfully corrected
since the current read operation started.
.TP
\fBIn Worst Block\fP (reading)
The first field shows the largest number of bad symbols that have been
detected in any one block of data since the current read operation started.
The second field is the number of Reed-Solomon parity symbols in each
block.  If the number of errors in a block exceeds 1/2 the number of parity
symbols then the block cannot be corrected.
.TP
\fBRecently\fP (reading)
Shows the largest number of bad symbols that have been detected in any one
block of data since the last time the \fB/proc\fP file was read.
.TP
\fBBad Blocks\fP (reading)
The number of blocks which the Reed-Solomon decoder detected could not be
corrected.  Not all uncorrectable blocks can be detected (imagine errors
occurring in such a way that they make the block look like another valid or
correctable block).
.TP
\fBFraming Errors\fP (reading)
An upper bound can be placed on the number of bytes which need to be
searched before a sector key is found and this displays the number of times
this bound was exceeded since the current read operation started.  Framing
errors do not necessarily represent lost data but are symptomatic of a poor
quality recording.
.TP
\fBOverrun Errors\fP (reading)
The number of times the sector sequence number skipped in the positive
direction indicating that the incoming video data filled the I/O buffer and
the computer could not keep up.
.TP
\fBUnderflows\fP (reading)
The number of times the sector sequence number skipped in the negative
direction indicating repeated sectors on the tape.  This indicates that
when the data was written, the computer could not generate it as fast as it
was being sent to tape causing the I/O buffer to empty (and then loop).
Apart from wasting several tens of kilobytes of tape, underflows are
non-destructive.
.TP
\fBWorst Key\fP (reading)
The lowest correlation value assigned to a string of bytes identified as
a sector key.
.TP
\fBClosest Non-Key\fP (reading)
The highest correlation value assigned to a string of bytes identified as
not being a sector key.
.TP
\fBLeast Skipped\fP (reading)
The least number of bytes which were skipped before locating a sector
key.
.TP
\fBMost Skipped\fP (reading)
The most number of bytes which were skipped before locating a sector key.
.TP
\fBI/O Buffer\fP (reading/writing)
The first field shows the number of bytes in the I/O buffer.  The second
field shows the size of the I/O buffer.  Ideally the buffer will be kept
completely full whilst writing and completely empty whilst reading.
.PP
The worst key and closest non-key must have a comfortable margin between
them if one is going to uniquely identify sector keys in the data stream.
The difference between the least and most skipped numbers shows the
variability in the number of lines generated by a VCR during playback.
.SH EXAMPLES
The examples below assume that \fB/dev/tape\fP is a link to the desired
device.
.SS "BASIC USE"
To save a file to tape, press Record and type
.RS
.sp
cp \fIfilename\fP /dev/tape
.sp
.RE
On your television, when the recording first starts, you will see the
beginning-of-record (BOR) mark which consists of vertical bars and will
last for several seconds.  That will be followed by what, for the most
part, is random noise until the recording ends with the end-of-record (EOR)
mark.  To verify the recording, position the tape just before or at the
beginning of the recording,  press Play and type
.RS
.sp
cmp /dev/tape \fIfilename\fP
.sp
.RE
To retrieve the file, position the tape at the start of the recording, as
above, and type
.RS
.sp
cp /dev/tape \fIfilename\fP
.sp
.RE
If the computer isn't fast enough to process the data in real time then
buffer over- and underflows will be seen.  In this case it will be necessary
to use off-line processing.  See
.IR bkrencode (8)
for more information.
.SS "USE WITH tar"
.IR tar (1)
processes data in ``records'' and the larger the record size the more
infrequently tar accesses the device.  If the time that elapses is too
long, then the driver's buffer can underflow (when writing) or overflow
(when reading).  This is true for all tape devices but older versions of
this driver were particularly bad due to Backer's relatively high transfer
speed for its buffer size which is limited by hardware to 64 kilobytes.  In
the past it was necessary to instruct tar to use a smaller than normal
record size as a work-around but the introduction of a large secondary
buffer in version 3.100 of the driver solved these problems and it is no
longer necessary to take any special precautions when using tar.  On faster
computers it is even possible to use
.IR bzip2 (1)
for compression since the driver can now buffer enough data to accommodate
even bzip2's painful duty cycle.
.PP
An example of making a backup using
.IR gzip (1)
compression is
.RS
.sp
tar -c -z -f /dev/tape [other options...]
.sp
.RE
and the corresponding restore command is
.RS
.sp
tar -x -z -f /dev/tape [other options...]
.sp
.RE
.PP
If your computer still has trouble keeping up with the data stream then try
changing the \fB-z\fP to \fB-Z\fP to use
.IR compress (1)
rather than gzip.  The compression will not be as good but there will be
less CPU overhead.  If it still doesn't work try it without any compression
at all.  If, on the other hand, your computer has no trouble processing
data at the required speed then you might try using bzip2 for compression
by using a command like
.RS
.sp
tar -c --use-compress-program bzip2 -f /dev/tape [other options...]
.sp
.RE
to write a tape.
.SS "MACHINE-TO-MACHINE COPYING"
If two computers with Backers are available then it is possible to use the
Backers to copy data between them.  This is accomplished by cross wiring
the cards (output of ``transmitter'' to input of ``receiver'') then at the
transmitting machine writing data to a device file while at the receiving
machine reading the data from the corresponding device file.  Any of the
non-raw modes can be chosen as long as both machines are speaking the same
one but PAL/high/SP (phs) is recommended since it has the highest code
rate.
.SH IOCTLS
The following
.IR ioctl (2)
calls are understood.
.IP \fBMTIOCTOP\fP
Accepts a pointer to an \fBmtop\fP structure which is used to access

.SH NOTES
.SS "EP RECORDINGS"
Since version 3.0 of the driver, the data conditioning and processing
algorithms used by the driver have been capable of storing and recovering
data from tapes recorded in EP (extended play) mode although it was not
particularly reliable.  With the addition of the
.IR bkrenhanced (8)
utility in version 3.1 and a new sector key locator algorithm in version
3.2, it became possible to reliably record data in EP modes.  Overall, EP
recordings to not offer significantly higher capacity than LP recordings
made on the same tape because the longer length of an EP recording is
partially offset its lower data rate.  If, however, your VCR is like mine
and does not have an LP mode then an EP recording is your only choice if
you want the higher capacity.
.SS "RECORDING LONGEVITY"
Backer's don't seem to be able to recover their data from tapes that have
been sitting for a long time.  My one data point in this matter is a tape
that I recorded at low density (with Danmere's Windows software) and then
tried to recover data from after it had sat on a shelf for two years.  For
the most part the tape could be recovered except for one file which could
not be.  The conclusion I have drawn from this is that this technology is
not well suited to the long-term archival of data.  It is, however, quite
well suited for the use it is meant for:  backing up a hard disk.
.PP
If you make regular backups then you will probably not need any one tape to
be readable beyond several months.  Over this period you should find you
have no problems at all with tape stability.  Obviously the stability of
the data on a tape can be improved by doing anything that will reduce the
likelihood of magnetic domains flipping.  This means keeping the tape away
from sources of heat and magnetic fields.  Don't leave tapes near furnace
grates, near radiators, sitting in the sun or even sitting in a room that
is excessively warmed by the sun.  Do not leave tapes near television sets,
near speakers, near electric motors, etc..
.PP
It is reasonable to expect EP recordings to be less stable than SP/LP
recordings.  If you do not make frequent backups, it is probably a better
idea to not use EP recordings until more is known about their relative
stability.
.SS "TAPE CARE"
VCRs are not as gentle with their tapes as data grade transports are
designed to be.  In particular, VCRs have a tendency to stretch tapes when
starting and stopping them as the transport mechanism unspools and spools
the tape from the cassette.  To improve the reliability of backups, try to
avoid as many start/stop cycles for each tape as is reasonably possible.
Especially avoid using the visual search functions of the VCR with any tape
that will be used to store data.  I should stress the word ``reasonably'',
though, since there's no need to be overly cautious --- I have actually
safely recovered data from visibly damaged tapes.
.SS "I/O SEMANTICS"
The POSIX standard does not specify the result, when working with
special files, of passing a byte count of 0 to the
.IR write (2)
system call.  For this device driver, a byte count of 0 is a normal write
operation with all of the usual side effects but no data is transfered.  In
other words, this will start a tape data transfer if one has not yet been
started then it will return 0 or the last error code is one is pending.
.PP
The
.IR close (2)
system call will block until all of the buffers have been flushed.  This
generally takes several seconds.

.SH BUGS
Sometimes, when writing to tape, the Backer hardware skips the first line
of data in the DMA buffer.  This shifts the video image up one line and
makes it hard for the driver to stop the card at a proper frame boundary.
The cause of this is unknown and the tape format is designed to work around
the problem.
