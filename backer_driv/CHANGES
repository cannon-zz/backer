0.7 (2000/11/03)
	Re-worked the I/O code's error reporting mechanism.  Save for any
	bugs that might be discovered in this stuff this now completes the
	system friendliness of the driver.

	Implemented the beginings of non-blocking I/O.  It's actually all
	in there but it's completely untested.  Since tar does not make use
	of non-blocking I/O there's no easy way to put this through its
	paces.  I'm going to have to write a test program.

	Fixed bug in overrun checking code:  the subtraction wasn't being
	done modulo the sequence size.  I hope this didn't cause any
	problems for anyone... 'cause it could have :-(.  It was defeating
	the ability of the driver to skip over underflows during playback.

	If an uncorrectable block is encountered, the driver now removes
	the block from the data stream and returns -ENODATA rather than
	silently pretending that nothing's wrong.

	If an error occurs in the data stream while reading the block
	sequence counter is now reset.  This keeps the quantity of lost
	data to a minimum.

	Some documentation updates and additions.

0.6 (2000/10/30)
	The driver now checks to see if a video signal is present before
	attempting to proceed with a transfer.  This avoids getting the
	system stuck in a busy loop until the driver times out.

	The device level I/O code will now always go to sleep for a 50th of
	a second between buffer updates rather than switching to a busy
	loop after the first two updates fail.  This keeps the driver from
	plugging up the system before actual tape data starts during a read
	and while flushing the buffer after writing.

	Driver now counts buffer overruns on read.

	Another minor performance improvement to the Reed-Solomon decoder.

0.5 (2000/10/25)
	Implemented an internal sector buffer.  Previously sectors were
	processed in place in the DMA buffer.  I had believed this was
	workable but it now seems that this makes the reliable handling of
	overruns too complicated.  Sectors are now processed in a seperate
	buffer which is transfered to/from the DMA buffer as a whole.  This
	extra copying of data introduces a small increase in the processing
	overhead.

	Added mandatory DMA buffer offset updates if a maximum update delay
	has been exceeded.  I hope that between this and the new sector
	buffer we will handle underflows during writing perfectly
	gracefully.  Preliminary tests look great!  I can force horrible
	buffer underflows during writing by using tar to write directly to
	the device while using bzip2 for compression.  By selecting a small
	record size I can generate many frequent underflows and so far I've
	been able to recover the data without any problems (knock on wood).

	Changed the bkrstatus structure.  Any applications retrieving this
	structure via an ioctl must be updated.

	Fixed a bug in the fame error checker:  the maximum search length
	allowed when finding the next key neglected to allow for the
	additional line in odd video fields.

	Minor performance enhancement to the Reed-Solomon decoding
	algorithm.

	Assorted code clean ups.

0.4 (2000/10/20)
	Fixed a bug in the sector locator algorithm which could cause the
	decoder to skip ahead of the incoming tape data.

	Fixed an erasure related buffer overflow in the Reed-Solomon
	decoder but it was not affecting this driver since the driver does
	not make use of erasures.

	Removed "feature" which caused reads to not terminate automatically
	if the tape data simply stopped (eg. without a proper EOR mark):
	ETIMEDOUT is now returned from the block layer rather than
	retrying.

	Improved sanity when switching modes.  Although I'd never had
	troubles myself, while checking the code I felt weird things might
	happen under certain read / close / mode change / open
	combinations.  Definitely all perfect now :-).

	Allowed randomizer to handle odd sized blocks by always allocating
	an even number of bytes for the block buffer.  This wasn't an issue
	yet since the blocks in all current formats have an even number of
	bytes in them.

0.3 (2000/10/17)
	Fixed bug in BKRIOCGETFORMAT ioctl which caused the block capacity
	to be reported as the number of data bytes contained in the current
	block rather than as the design capacity of a block.

	Removed memory access priviledge checks from the read() and write()
	methods --- the kernel (in 2.0.36 at least) checks for us.

	Many documentation improvements.

0.2 (2000/10/10)
	First public release.
