<h2>Here's what you see on your television</h2>

<h3>Stable 3.x Versions</h3>

<p>
These images are for NTSC video.&nbsp; Most televisions can't display some
number of the top and bottom lines of video so they won't actually be
visible on your set.&nbsp; These pictures were obtained by piping the
output of <font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrencode</font> into a program
I've written for analyzing tape data streams and then doing a screen
capture with the <a href="http://www.gimp.org"><font face="Courier
New,Courier">GIMP</font></a>.

This first shot is of a data sector (one video field) and it's not too
helpful unless you know what you're looking at.&nbsp;  The same output can
be generated on your television by typing

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">cat /dev/zero > /dev/backer/0/nhs</font>

<p>The version 3.x format is not as much of an improvement over 2.x as 2.x
was over 1.x but it is not without its merits.&nbsp; The error control code
is now used to only correct errors in actual data, it is not wasted
correcting errors in unused portions of the sector.&nbsp; Also, the key
bytes are spread more uniformly throughout the sector.&nbsp; This last
improvement combined with a new, more robust, algorithm for identifying the
key bytes means that it is practically impossible for noise to cause a
sector to be lost --- the software can accurately identify sectors even on
tapes which have been badly physically damaged.

This image is more informative.&nbsp; This is a sector from the BOR mark
and it allows you to make out the structure of the format.&nbsp; First, the
vertical lines down the left side of the image are not part of the tape
data.&nbsp; They are produced by the Backer hardware which prefixes each
line of video with the byte 0x45.&nbsp;  This presumably provides the means
by which the hardware's bit clock is synchronized on playback.&nbsp; The
top few lines contain the sector leader which is just filled with 0xe2 and
is used to pad out the first few, unusable, lines of video.&nbsp; Likewise
the bottom few lines contain the sector trailer which also pads out
unusable lines but with 0x33.&nbsp; The key bytes can be seen scattered
diagonally through the sector and are used to find sectors in the data
stream.&nbsp; The vertical bars filling the bulk of the image are the
filler bytes (0x33) used in BOR and EOR sectors and would contain data if
this were a normal data sector.&nbsp; The parity bytes are at the bottom,
filling several lines immediately above the trailer.&nbsp; Finally the
sector header can be made out as four bytes, here all 0, appearing just
above the parity bytes towards the right side of the video frame.

Here's what a low density data sector looks like.  You can get output like
this by typing

<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">cat /dev/zero > /dev/backer/0/nls</font>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER NOSAVE BGCOLOR=#808090><img SRC="3_0_dat_nl.png" height=253 width=320>

And here's a sector from the low density BOR mark.

Here's what <font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrmonitor</font> looks like</h2>

<h3>Version 3.2</h3>

<center><table COLS=2 NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>This shows <font face="Courier
New,Courier">bkrmonitor</font> after a 545 million byte recording that had
been made in EP mode was recovered from tape.&nbsp; As you can see, the raw
recording could not be recovered from tape completely error-free as there
were 108 uncorrectable data blocks.&nbsp;  However, this recording was made
using the new <font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrenhanced</font> utility
which had no trouble filling in the lost sectors as can be seen from it's
output below

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier">
bkrenhanced: DECODING at 92.2% efficiency<br>
bkrenhanced: Number of lost sectors detected:  108 of 321045<br>
bkrenhanced: Number of errors in worst block:  3 (20 allowed)<br>
</font>

<p>
This shows that 108 sectors of the 321045 data sectors in the recording
needed to be corrected which is a mean error rate of about
3*10<sup>-4</sup>.&nbsp; We also see that no sector group required more
than 3 of its 255 sectors to be replaced.&nbsp; <font face="Courier
New,Courier">bkrenhanced</font>'s error control code can replace up to 20
sectors in each group so there appears to be plenty of headroom as one would
expect given the mean error rate and the code rate.
