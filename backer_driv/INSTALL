           Quick Install Guide for the Backer 16/32 Device Driver
           ======================================================

Full instructions can be found in the User's Guide.

1.  Configure the driver parameters for your system.  The constants that
should be set are:

	In backer_isa.c:
		BKR_MAJOR
		BKR_DEF_IOPORT
		BKR_DEF_DMA_CHANNEL

	In backer.h:
		BKR_DEF_MODE
		BKR_DEF_TIMEOUT

Of these, the only one that actually must be set is the device major
number.  The I/O port, DMA channel, default mode and timeout can be set at
module load time although you might as well configure them now to simplify
things later.


2.  Compile and install the driver to the modules directory.  This is done
by typing (while logged in as root)

	make
	make install

or you can just run make and copy the resulting backer.o to your modules
directory, /lib/modules/<kernel version>/misc, yourself.


3.  Create a device file.  Do this (still as root) by typing

	mknod -m 666 /dev/backer c 60 0

or with the 60 replaced with whatever major number you had set in the
header file.  The driver is designed to imitate a standard magnetic tape
drive and if you want to use your Backer as your default tape device you
should also create a symbolic link called /dev/tape

	cp -s /dev/backer /dev/tape


4.  To load the driver, login as root and type

	insmod backer [options]

where the following options can be set:

	ioport=num            Set the I/O port to num.
	dma=num               Set the DMA channel to num.
	buffer=num            Set the DMA buffer size to num bytes.
	config=mode,timeout   Set the mode and timeout (seconds).

Here's an example install command:

insmod backer ioport=0x304 dma=3 config=0x59,20


5.  To test the driver just type

	cat /dev/zero > /dev/backer
