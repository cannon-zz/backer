LOADING/UNLOADING THE DRIVER
----------------------------

To load the driver, login as root and type

	insmod backer [options]

where the following options can be set:

	ioport=num
		Set the I/O port to num.
	dma=num
		Set the DMA channel to num.
	timeout=num
		Set the timeout to num seconds.

Here's an example install command:

	insmod backer ioport=0x304 dma=3 timeout=20

You'll get an error message if the driver couldn't be installed.  If that
happens, check /var/log/messages to see what the problem was.  The driver will
have printed a little banner and will have complained if it couldn't reserve a
particular resource.  Note that to allow the DMA channel to be shared, the
driver will only request access to it when the device is actually in use so
successfully loading the driver does not guarantee that there are no resource
conflicts.

To test the driver just type

	cat /dev/zero > /dev/tape

to verify that data is being written to video.  On your television set you
should see some vertical bars for a few seconds (the BOR mark) followed by
something that looks like noise.  Press CTRL-C to stop the test.

To unload the module type

	rmmod backer
