0.5 (2000/10/25)
	bkrlog will now only send an update of the auxiliary region to the
	device if more than 250 milliseconds have elapsed.

	Minor changes to bkrencode to reflect code clean ups in the
	formating layer.

	The font .xpm file's name didn't match the string defined within it
	(I had renamed it without editing the string name).  They match
	now.  I also made changes to the 'm' and 'S' glyphs.

0.4 (2000/10/20)
	Fixed sector efficiency and data rate computation errors in bkrtest
	--- you can now actually use the data rate along with your tape
	length to compute a tape capacity.

0.3 (2000/10/17)
	Re-release to keep version number in step with driver.

0.2 (2000/10/10)
	First public release.
