3.3 (2001/7/5)
	Documentation updates and fixes.

	bkrmonitor is now able to retrieve its input from stdin.

	Cleaned up bkrenhanced a bit:  realized there is no way for it to
	operate without communicating directly with the driver so I removed
	all of the formatting options and other things related to its use
	without the driver.

	Added state display to bkrmonitor.

3.2 (2001/6/26)
	Fixed a bug in bkrmonitor that prevented it from properly parsing
	/proc/driver/backer if there were multiple devices listed.  Also
	fixed bug that would hang bkrmonitor if the driver was unloaded.

	bkrenhanced had been allowing the erasure location array to be
	overwritten by the error correction routine.  It doesn't now.  What
	it was doing might not have been a half bad thing to do though.
	Hmm...  Ok, put this back the way it was but now bkrenhanced
	updates the erasure count appropriately.

	Updated stdio_dev.c and bkrencode.c for changes to device layer in
	kernel code.

	Fixed a critical array index foul-up in bkrenhanced.  Don't know
	why it even worked at all!

3.1 (2001/6/24)
	Changed the error exit codes from -1 (255) to 1.

	Added the bkrenhanced utility as a further step towards making EP
	recordings as reliable as SP/LP.  This is still experimental,
	however.

	Fixed the way bkrcheck determines the size of a file:  I hadn't
	known there was such a thing as the stat() system call :-).

	Brought stdio_dev.c and bkrencode.c in line with the changes to the
	driver sources caused by the addition of multiple device support.

	Updated bkrmonitor for the new proc interface.

3.0 (2001/6/2)
	Brought stdio_dev.c and bkrencode.c in line with the changes to the
	driver sources caused by the addition of power management.

	Removed -a option from bkrencode for real this time :-P (it was
	still listed as a case in the switch statement).

	A few minor tweaks to streamline reads & writes in stdio_dev.c.

	Added -s option to bkrencode for skipping bad sectors.

	Replaced the greyed-out buttons in bkrmonitor with some text
	labels.

2.1 (2001/4/29)
	Documentation updates.

	Removed -a option from bkrencode.  The -f option is used instead
	but with the file name now being optional (-f with no file name is
	equivalent to the old -a).

	With the driver's new /proc status output, bkrmonitor was returned
	to a purely graphical application and now gets its info from the
	/proc entry rather than the (now non-existent) ioctl call.
	bkrmonitor no longer needs to be stopped and started if the driver's
	mode is changed.

	bkrcheck's tape length calculation now works properly with raw
	devices.

	Due to changes in the device driver's formating code, bkrencode can
	now skip over the junk sectors that are always found at the start
	of a recording.

	The default mode for bkrencode is now in the Makefile so it's
	easier to edit and can get pasted into the man page.

	Brought stdio_dev and bkrencode in line with the new blocking logic
	used in the device driver's code.

	Made the exit codes more consistent so that the utilities work as
	expected in scripts (at least as I expect them too...).

2.0 (2001/4/12)
	Documentation updates and corrections.

	bkrencode couldn't be set for EP mode due to a conflict in the mode
	flags.  Fixed by changing the flags around a bit.

	bkrmonitor can now send its output to stdout and will be built as a
	text-only version if GTK is not available.

	The Makefile's been given a make-over.

1.107 (2001/3/24)
	Adjusted some more of bkrcheck's messages.

	Changed a bunch of command line arguments and messages to match
	the new mode flag structures of the driver.  The utilities, like
	the driver, now consider there to simply be three data formats (SP,
	EP and raw) rather than two formated modes and a pass-through mode.

	Added the total error count to bkrmonitor.

	Moved all of the documentation into text files and man pages to be
	more "standard".

1.106 (2001/3/14)
	Did some behind-the-scenes fiddling with stdio_dev.c for the sake
	of another project I'm working on:  the read buffer is now kept at
	50% full rather than 100%.

	Adjusted some of the messages printed by bkrcheck.

1.105 (2001/3/9)
	Upgraded my system to glibc 2.2 and had to fix bkrencode to work
	with the new errno behaviour.  Should still work with older
	glibc's.

1.104 (2001/3/4)
	Split bkrencode's standard I/O device layer into a separate file.
	This facilitates its use in a new utility (TBA).  Also cleaned up
	bkrencode and it's I/O layer a bit... might be a bit faster now but
	I've never benchmarked it so I can't tell.

1.103 (2001/2/20)
	Brought the utilities in line with the new /dev layout.  This
	included deleting bkrmode.

1.102 (2001/2/13)
	Got bkrencode working with the new formating code.

	Moved the documentation for the utilities into a separate file.

1.101 (2001/2/8)
	Brought the utilities in line with the new access semantics of the
	driver.

	Added the Error Rate indicator to bkrmonitor.

1.100 (2001/1/29)
	A re-work of the device driver header files forced some stuff to
	get a make-over.

	bkrlog's rocky career continues with it's very life now hanging in
	the balance.  It's raison d'etre --- the auxiliary data region ---
	has left us.  I really liked writing rude messages into my system
	backups, though, so I'm not going to delete it quite yet... ;-)

	bkrtest has been reborn as bkrcheck and its role has expanded.  If
	you give it a file name, it will tell you how much tape that file
	will occupy given the current driver settings.

	bkrmonitor now displays the current sector number.

1.0 (2001/1/13)
	Changed the 'N' glyph in bkrfont.xpm.

	Got bkr_aux_puts() to generate Backer-friendly data.  This gets
	bkrlog working finally.

	Re-worked bkrlog:  new output scheduler mechanism and cleaner
	handling of tar archive label.

0.12 (2000/12/11)
	The mode indicators in bkrmonitor now indicate the mode and are
	disabled in order to discourage people from trying to click them.
	(this looks stupid but it's good enough for now).

	bkrlog now prints an error message before exiting if it runs out of
	memory.

	Fixed a bug in bkrencode:  while encoding it could get hung on EOF.

	Expanded bkrencode's error reporting to include errors from the
	file system.

0.11 (2000/11/26)
	Re-release to keep the version number in step with the driver.

0.10 (2000/11/21)
	bkrencode now catches SIGINT and generates an EOR mark before
	exiting.

	Changed the '$' glyph in bkrfont.xpm.

	Code clean ups in bkrlog (but don't use it yet) and new messages.

0.9 (2000/11/16)
	Cleaned up some code in bkrmonitor and bkrencode.

0.8 (2000/11/06)
	Fixed error message strings in bkrencode and bkrtest.

	Introduced new utility bkrmonitor.  This is a gtk+ application for
	monitoring the status of the driver and hardware during a transfer.

	Added underflow field to error structure.  This indicates the
	number of underflows detected in the data stream.  These are most
	likely present due to buffer underflows occurring when the data was
	recorded but might also indicate an overflow condition if much time
	has elapsed since the last read.

0.7 (2000/11/03)
	Minor modifications to the I/O code in bkrencode to work with new
	error reporting scheme.  Also made bkrencode abort on any error.

0.6 (2000/10/30)
	Re-release to keep version number in step with driver.

0.5 (2000/10/25)
	bkrlog will now only send an update of the auxiliary region to the
	device if more than 250 milliseconds have elapsed.

	Minor changes to bkrencode to reflect code clean ups in the
	formating layer.

	The font .xpm file's name didn't match the string defined within it
	(I had renamed it without editing the string name).  They match
	now.  I also made changes to the 'm' and 'S' glyphs.

0.4 (2000/10/20)
	Fixed sector efficiency and data rate computation errors in bkrtest
	--- you can now actually use the data rate along with your tape
	length to compute a tape capacity.

0.3 (2000/10/17)
	Re-release to keep version number in step with driver.

0.2 (2000/10/10)
	First public release.
