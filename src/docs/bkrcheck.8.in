.TH BKRCHECK 8 "November 23, 2002" "Linux" "Backer"
.SH NAME
bkrcheck \- Backer device I/O testing tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbkrcheck\fP [\fB\-Dh\fP|\fB\-Dl\fP] [\fB\-Fe\fP|\fB\-Fr\fP|\fB\-Fs\fP]
[\fB\-Vn\fP|\fB\-Vp\fP] [\fB\-f\fP[\fIdevname\fP]] [\fB\-h\fP]
[\fB\-T\fP\fIformat_table\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbkrcheck\fP writes a data stream to
.IR stdout (3)
that is suitable for use in testing the operation of the
.IR backer (4)
device driver.
.PP
The operation of a Backer device can be tested by simply dumping a data
stream to one of the device files.  By using the particular data stream
generated by \fBbkrcheck\fP, however, one can check for the correct
reproduction of a specific test pattern in the video signal.  This provides
a much stricter test of the device driver's and hardware's operation.
.PP
It is necessary to inform \fBbkrcheck\fP of the desired output format.
There are three ways in which this can be done:  the format can be
specified, piecewise, via individual command line options; it can be
obtained from a particular Backer device file specified via a command line
option; or it can be retrieved automatically from
.IR stdout (3).
See
.IR bkrencode (8)
for information on data stream format specification.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-Dh\fP, \fB\-Dl\fP
The byte stream is formated for high density (\fBDh\fP) or low density
(\fBDl\fP).
.TP
\fB\-Fe\fP, \fB\-Fr\fP, \fB\-Fs\fP
The byte stream is formated for EP (\fBFe\fP), RAW (\fBFr\fP) or SP
(\fBFs\fP).
.TP
\fB\-Vn\fP, \fB\-Vp\fP
The byte stream is formated for NTSC video (\fBVn\fP) or PAL video
(\fBVp\fP).
.TP
\fB\-f\fP[\fIdevname\fP]
Retrieve the format to use for the byte stream from a Backer device file.
If \fIdevname\fP is provided then that file is used, otherwise the mode is
retrieved from \fB@DEFAULT_DEV@\fP.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Print a usage message.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP\fIformat_table\fP
Read a format parameter table from the file \fIformat_table\fP.  See
.IR backer (4)
for information on the format of this file.
.SH EXAMPLES
To check the operation of Backer device 0 in high density, raw, NTSC mode
simply type
.RS 3
.sp
\fB$\fP bkrcheck >/dev/backer/0/nhr
