Introduction
============

This directory contains some extra things that users of the device driver
might find helpful.


format.gnumeric
===============

Since version 3.1 of the driver, the code for calculating the format
parameters in backer_fmt.c was replaced with a look-up table.
format.gnumeric is a Gnumeric spread sheet for computing the parameters
allowing new, consistent, look-up tables to be produced.  This will be
needed by anyone who wishes to experiment with the tape format.  When the
spread sheet is loaded, the columns shaded in green are the columns that
can be adjusted.  The other columns cannot be edited directly because they
are either computed parameters or are determined by the hardware
characteristics of the Backer.

When adjusting numbers, the columns to pay particular attention to are the
``Buffer Size'' and the ``Block n'' columns.  Both must be integers.
