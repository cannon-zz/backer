<h3>What is a Backer?</h3>

<p>
A company in England named <a href="http://www.danmere.com">Danmere Technologies Ltd.</a> (now <a
href="http://www.4-tv.net">4TV Ltd.</a>) used to sell a line of devices
that allow you to save data on regular video tape.&nbsp; They called them
Backers and they came in three flavours:&nbsp; an external version that
plugs into an ECP parallel port and two internal versions that sit in ISA
bus slots.&nbsp; If you remember the days of using audio cassettes to store
programs and data then the operation of a Backer device should be familiar
to you.

<p>
Unfortunately, Danmere would neither provide Linux drivers for their
products nor were they willing to release programming information to
developers who were willing to do so for them.&nbsp; The last e-mails I
sent to them on the subject were not responded to.&nbsp; Finally, as of the
fall of 2002, their web site has disappeared.&nbsp; Oh well...

<p>
It turns out the Backer hardware is extremely simple and contains virtually
no data processing intelligence whatsoever.&nbsp; It plays the role of a
modem, blindly modulating a byte stream into and demodulating it out of a
video signal.&nbsp; External software is required to perform all data
framing, error correction, etc. .&nbsp; The advantage of this design is
that it reduces the cost of the hardware and permits a great deal of
flexibility in matching the tape format to the video equipment in use.


<h3>What is this software?</h3>

<p>
The software discussed on this page is a Linux device driver for Backers
that allows you to use them as though they were standard magnetic tape
devices.&nbsp; With this driver, you can perform backups of your system
using, for example, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html">GNU
<font face="Courier New,Courier">tar</font></a> or the archive software of
your choice.

<p>
You can download the latest stable and unstable versions of the driver from
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12360">here</a>.

<p>
The driver version numbering works as follows.&nbsp; The version major
number (the number to the left of the decimal place) indicates the native
tape format.&nbsp; This number is increased when the driver's tape format
changes in a way that makes it incompatible with previous versions.&nbsp;
The minor number (the number to the right of the decimal place) indicates
the release number.&nbsp; Minor numbers less than 100 are stable releases
and will all use the same, well tested, tape format.&nbsp; Minor numbers
greater than or equal to 100 are unstable, developmental, releases leading
up to the next major release.&nbsp;  Developmental releases might not be
well tested and might not use the same format from release to release.


<h3>Capabilities (stable 3.x drivers)</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<h4>Data Formats</h4>
The driver has two native data formats and a pass-through mode.&nbsp; One
of the formats is optimized for SP and LP recordings and the other for EP
recordings.&nbsp; The pass-through mode provides applications with access
to the raw tape data stream.

<p>
The data formats used by this driver are not compatible with the data
formats used by Danmere's Windows software.&nbsp; The driver's pass-through
modes can be used to read and write non-native formats through the use of
helper applications but I have not written such a utility for Danmere's
format and have no plans to do so.

<p><li>
<h4>Data Transfer Rates</h4>
These are calculated assuming 60 fields per second for NTSC and 50 fields
per second for PAL.

<p><li>
<h4>Tape Capacities</h4>
Multiply the numbers above by your tape length and compression ratio.&nbsp;
For example, for NTSC video a T-120 in SP mode at high density can hold 888
MiB uncompressed (120 minutes * 129360 bytes/second).&nbsp; Danmere's best
figures are obtained assuming a high density recording (probably PAL) on a
T-180 in LP mode with 2:1 compression for which they claim either a <a
href="http://www.danmere.com/backer/internaltechspec.htm">2.8 GiB</a> or <a
href="http://www.danmere.com/backerindex.htm">3.7 GiB</a> tape capacity
depending on which web page you read.&nbsp; Under the same conditions, this
software's tape capacity would be 5.3 GiB.&nbsp; Why ``would be''?&nbsp;
Because my VCR (along with every other VCR sold these days it seems) does
not have an LP mode and 2:1 compression is probably a bit optimistic if
your disks are full of <font face="Courier New,Courier">.mp3</font>s and
other pre-compressed data.

<p>
For a real-world benchmark, my system partition has 2.6 GiB of data on it
(excluding <font face="Courier New,Courier">/tmp</font>, etc.) which
compresses to 552 MiB using <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2"><font
face="Courier New,Courier">bzip2</font></a>, or about 2/3 of a T-120.

<p>
The highest capacity one could <i>hope</i> to achieve is with an EP
recording on a T-200 with 2:1 compression.&nbsp; Such a recording can hold
6.8 GiB in NTSC format and 7.1 GiB in PAL format.

</ul>


<h3>System Requirements</h3>
These are the system requirements that I am aware of.&nbsp; Most of them
are not fundamental and could be relaxed if people with the appropriate
systems could help test and debug the code.
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Backer hardware</h4>
Internal, ISA, version of the device.&nbsp; Support for the external
version is currently in development&nbsp; The latest unstable release of
the driver includes a module, <font face="Courier
New,Courier">backer_parport</font>, that you can go ahead and try but more
than likely it will not work for you.

<p><li>
<h4>Video equipment</h4>
The driver is known to work with NTSC video equipment.&nbsp; I do not have
access to PAL video equipment so I cannot test the software's
operation in this video mode but it should work.&nbsp; If it doesn't work
then getting it to work is just a matter of adjusting a few numbers.&nbsp;
If you have PAL equipment and know that the driver works with it, please
let me know so I can update this page.&nbsp; If you have PAL equipment,
know that the driver does not work with it and would like that to change
then drop me a line.

<p><li>
<h4>System architecture</h4>
Verions prior to 3.0 required i386-like system architecture:&nbsp; a little
endian system capable of unaligned memory reads and writes.&nbsp; Since
version 3.0, the software should work on any system supported by
Linux.&nbsp; I can only test the driver itself on an x86 system but I have
compiled and run <font face="Courier New,Courier">bkrencode</font> on an
IBM RS-6000 running AIX (big endian, unaligned OK) and it worked perfectly
so I believe the portability issues have been addressed.

<p><li>
<h4>Linux kernel</h4>
The following table indicates the kernel version I had installed on my own
system while developing various versions of the driver.  Thus, this table
does not represent absolute requirements but rather combinations that are
known to work.

2.0.36
</table>
</center>

<p><li> <h4>Minimum CPU</h4>
I do not know the minimum CPU required.&nbsp; What I do know is that my
PII-400 system can process tape data approximately 27 times faster than the
actual tape data rate.  If we assume, then, that a computer 27 times slower
than a PII-400 would still (just) be able to process a data stream in real
time, then a 486DX-33 is probably the bottom end of what's workable.&nbsp;
Unlike Danmere's software, however, this driver does not require the data
to be processed in real time.&nbsp; Using offline processing, I suspect
that even a 386SX-16 would work just fine.

A software package that, together with some hardware, allows your PC to act
as an infrared remote control.&nbsp; I haven't actually downloaded and
checked this software out but it looks like combining it with tape
operations in a script could allow you to fully automate your Backer/VCR
combination allowing you to do unattended backups.
