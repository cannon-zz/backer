                           INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                           =========================

Here are the steps for installing the utilities associated with the Backer
device driver.

1.  Edit the Makefile.  There are a few things that need to be set in the
Makefile.  These are:

    DRIVER_DIR    The location of the device driver sources.
    PREFIX        The top of the installation hierarchy.
    DEVICE_NAME   The default device name to compile into the utilities.
    DEFAULT_MODE  The default mode to compile into bkrencode.

The executables will be put in $(PREFIX)/bin and the man pages in
$(PREFIX)/man/man8.

The install directories are not referred to within the applications
themselves so you can safely set PREFIX to a location other than the final
install location.  For example, you might find PREFIX=${RPM_BUILD_ROOT}/usr
to be convenient if you are building an RPM.

For the constants to use for DEFAULT_MODE, see $(DRIVER_DIR)/backer.h.


2.  Build the utilities.  Typing

	make
	
builds the utilities and the man pages.  If GTK is not installed then
bkrmonitor will not be built.  If you do have GTK installed but the build
script can't find it, manually specify the location of gtk-config like this

	make GTK_CONFIG=/usr/bin/gtk-config

or whatever is appropriate for your system.


3.  Install.  Typing

	make install

installs the utilities and a man page for each one.
