0.4 ()
	Fixed a bug in the sector locator algorithm which could cause the
	decoder to skip ahead of the incoming tape data.

	Fixed an erasure related buffer overflow in the Reed-Solomon
	decoder but it was not affecting this driver since the driver does
	not make use of erasures.

	Removed "feature" which caused reads to not terminate automatically
	if the tape data simply stopped (eg. without a proper EOR mark):
	ETIMEDOUT is now returned from the block layer rather than
	retrying.

	Improved sanity when switching modes.  Although I'd never had
	troubles myself, while checking the code I felt weird things might
	happen under certain read / close / mode change / open
	combinations.  Definitely all perfect now :-).

	Allowed randomizer to handle odd sized blocks by always allocating
	an even number of bytes for the block buffer.  This wasn't an issue
	yet since the blocks in all current formats have an even number of
	bytes in them.

0.3 (2000/10/17)
	Fixed bug in BKRIOCGETFORMAT ioctl which caused the block capacity
	to be reported as the number of data bytes contained in the current
	block rather than as the design capacity of a block.

	Removed memory access priviledge checks from the read() and write()
	methods --- the kernel (in 2.0.36 at least) checks for us.

	Many documentation improvements.

0.2 (2000/10/10)
	First public release.
